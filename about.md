**Hey! 👋** my name is Juan Sebastián Ocampo Ospina AKA @oky_capriatto,

👦🏻 Born in 1993 in the charming balcony of Valle del Cauca in Colombia (Sevilla). Passionate about computers from my father's legacy and love for the guitar and music from my mother's relatives.

🏕️ Scout since the age of 13 and passionate about the outdoors and nature. My favorite snack is [choclitos](https://www.google.com/search?q=choclitos+colombia). I currently live with Camila, my co-pilot and inspiration to be a better person and contribute to society (she is a Social Worker).

👨🏻‍💻 I am a Technologist in information systems and systems and computing engineer.

⌨️ My first programming language was Java and then PHP, but later I got to know ERP (enterprise resource planners) in a learning club called GIDSOFT (Software Research and Development Group). There my interest in Odoo and Python was born.

🏢 I have worked with Odoo in the wholesale and retail industry, health and service sales. Ultimately focused on ensuring Odoo interoperability with legacy or outsourced platforms.

💼👨🏻‍💼 In addition to being a developer, I have also been an Odoo consultant, since there are many companies that require help in the technological transformation of their organizations.

⚡ Currently focused on improving my JavaScript skills. Not only for Odoo but to expand my competitiveness in the industry. Also because I have a charity project in progress and I want to use it.

💹 I am projected in the medium term to develop tools for the financial industry, either for prediction or trading of financial instruments.
